# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It's a simple recipe website that will demonstrate my HTML skills. By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Setting up a GitHub repository
- Cloning a repository to my local machine
- Creating and structuring HTML files
- Using basic HTML tags to create content
- Linking between HTML pages
- Committing and pushing changes to GitHub

As I progress through the project, I'll be adding more recipes and improving the structure and content of the website.
